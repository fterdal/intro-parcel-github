# Lab.Intro-Parcel

## Goals for this tutorial:

* Understand what a bundler is for
* Understand how to install and set up Parcel
* Resolve a few common gotchas
  * async await
  * browserslist
* Understand "entry-point"

## Stretch Goals (or maybe just a future module)

* Set up Parcel middleware in Express
* Understand "dist" and ".cache"
* Understand "hot module reloading"
* Use Parcel to build for production
  * Deploy? Heroku?? Netlify???

## Steps

### Step 1: Setting Up

* Clone the starting point repo (has browserslist defined, but not much else)?

* Install Parcel
```
npm install parcel-bundler
```

* Create src directory. Add some files.
```sh
mkdir src
touch src/index.html src/style.css src/main.js src/helpers.js
```

* Paste some code into each file
TODO: Create all that stuff for pasting ðŸ™ƒ

* Run the code by opening the index.html in browser

### Step 2: Add Parcel

* Notice the import / export statements. They don't work. In fact, they generate errors.
* Install Parcel
  * `npm install parcel-bundler`
* NPM install faker
* Run Parcel
  * Add "start": "parcel src/index.html" to package.json scripts
  * `npm start`
  * It will notice that there's an import that hasn't been installed yet (faker)
    and installs that. Whoa, that's weird.
  * It'll also create two new folders: dist and .cache
  * Take a look at dist/index.html.
    * Notice how it's transformed the original into something slightly different.
  * Take a look at the browser: [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)
  * Make a change to the HTML or CSS.
    * See how it reloads immediately? Very much wow!

### Step 3: Profit
